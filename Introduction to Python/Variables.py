# In Python, we don't need to explicitly declare variable types.

# Assigning values to variables
age = 21
interest_rate = 2.5
home = "Comilla"
district = 'Chittagong'

# Printing variable values
print("Age:", age)
print("Interest Rate:", interest_rate)
print("Home:", home)
print("District:", district)
print("\n")

# If we want to know the variable type, we will use the type() function
print("Type of age:", type(age))
print("Type of interest_rate:", type(interest_rate))
print("Type of home:", type(home))
print("Type of district:", type(district))

# Note: String concatenation can be done using the '+' operator or f-strings.
# Example:
print("Sarafat Karim" + "is a good boy!")  # This is one way.
# Alternatively, you can use f-strings:
message = f"He is trying to be disciplined"  # This is another way.
print(message)

# Keyboard Shortcuts:
# CTRL + \ = Single Line Comment
# ALT + SHIFT + A = Doc String or Multi Line Comment
